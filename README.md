## Description

This project is an SVM-based fruit quality classifier that categorizes fruits into 3 quality levels (Good, Bad, Mixed) based on features extracted from images ([Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shashwatwork/fruitnet-indian-fruits-dataset-with-quality/data)). The project includes preprocessing of images, feature extraction, training an SVM classifier, and testing its performance.
